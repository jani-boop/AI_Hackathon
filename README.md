##### Time is 24 hours
So submit a pull request within the stipulated time along with a readme file that explais how to run the code 

### Some key pointers:
1. Identify a problem you are passionate about
2. Then find a relevant dataset(It may be small but that is where transfer learning becomes important)
3. Use a suitable model and apply the learnings
